### 1-1 Introduction
#### ```1-1-1 What is Machine Learning?```  
Two definitions of ```Machine``` Learning are offered. Arthur Samuel described it as: "the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." This is an older, informal definition.  

Tom Mitchell provides a more modern definition: "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."  

Example: playing checkers.  
  
E = the experience of playing many games of checkers  
  
T = the task of playing checkers.  
  
P = the probability that the program will win the next game.  
  
In general, any machine learning problem can be assigned to one of two broad classifications:  
  
Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning.
